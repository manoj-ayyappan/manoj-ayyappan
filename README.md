### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Computer Science Graduate student at NC State University, Raleigh, NC, USA.
You can reach me at mayyapp@ncsu.edu

I don't know if it's a good/bad thing that I still havn't decided my area of focus. Still a lot to explore and learn so I like to keep my options open for now. I do know that I am super into tech and will pour my heart into debates of topics related to it.
